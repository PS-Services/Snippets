## MCP Server Claude Plugin and Hook Contract

Claude must treat MCP Server plugin and hook setup as a live runtime contract, not background documentation. On every new Claude session in this workspace, and whenever MCP Server behavior looks stale, incomplete, or inconsistent, perform this validation before relying on MCP Server workflows.

### Required Startup Validation

1. Read `AGENTS-README-FIRST.yaml` from the active workspace root and use it as the current source of truth for MCP Server endpoint, API key, workspace path, plugin instructions, and failure-reporting rules.
2. Identify the active MCP Server Claude plugin cache path and version from the marker file, plugin manifest, or active wrapper path. Do not assume a previously cached path is current.
3. Inspect `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\plugins\cache` for stale MCP Server plugin entries. Delete stale `mcpserver`, `mcpserver-*`, or `mcpserver-cowork` cache entries that are not the active plugin cache path/version for this session.
4. Do not delete the active plugin cache path for the current session. If unsure which path is active, stop deleting and report the ambiguity.
5. Reload or rebootstrap the active MCP Server Claude plugin after stale cache cleanup.
6. Inspect Claude active settings, including user-level and workspace/session-level settings, and verify MCP Server hooks are actually installed in the active settings layer. Do not accept hook files existing in the plugin package as proof that hooks are active.
7. If hooks are missing or stale, install or refresh them through the supported MCP Server Claude plugin hook validation skill or wrapper path.
8. Verify the plugin wrapper/status command works and record the exact command or tool path used.
9. Verify subprocesses launched by the plugin use the workspace root as process current working directory, not the inherited user profile directory.

### Required Usage Rules

1. Use supported MCP Server plugin wrappers, hooks, skills, or MCP tools for session logging, TODOs, requirements, triage, and status checks. Do not use raw REST when a supported wrapper, hook, skill, or MCP tool exists.
2. Session logging must use the supported session wrapper or MCP tools and must create, update, and complete turns through the plugin flow.
3. TODO operations must use the supported TODO wrapper, workflow, or MCP tools. Do not edit TODO storage directly.
4. Requirements operations must use the supported requirements wrapper, workflow, or MCP tools. Do not edit requirements storage directly.
5. Triage operations must use the supported triage wrapper, workflow, or MCP tools.
6. MCP Server failures and plugin failures discovered while doing unrelated work must be reported through triage only, then Claude must continue the user active task.
7. If triage submission is unavailable because MCP Server or the plugin is unavailable, write the normal failsafe YAML report through the plugin failsafe flow and continue non-MCP work. Do not invent a raw REST fallback or alternate reporting channel.
8. Normal plugin execution must use PowerShell only. Bash is allowed only for installing PowerShell. Node must not be used for JSON or YAML construction.
9. JSON and YAML payloads must be built from native objects and serialized. Do not handwrite YAML or JSON as fragile string literals.
10. If any validation check fails, report the exact failed check, the path or command involved, and the blocked capability. Do not claim MCP Server compliance until the check is fixed or explicitly marked unavailable.

### Minimum Validation Report

When asked to validate plugin or hook usage, Claude must return a concise report containing:

- Active workspace path.
- Marker file path and timestamp.
- Active plugin cache path and version.
- Stale plugin cache paths deleted.
- Hook settings file paths inspected.
- Hooks found, installed, or refreshed.
- Wrapper/status command used and result.
- Session logging validation result.
- TODO validation result.
- Requirements validation result.
- Triage validation result.
- Process current working directory validation result.
- Any remaining mismatch, unavailable surface, or failure.
